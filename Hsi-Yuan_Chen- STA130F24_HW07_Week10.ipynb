    "Benefits of Mulitple Linear Regression:\n",
    "- Accounts for more predictors: This allows us to model mutiple factors that might influence the outcome. \n",
    "- Reduces ommited variable bias: Including additional variables reduces the bias caused by omitting important predictors. \n",
    "- Improves Model Fit: Explains more variability in the outcome variable (Y). Often leads to a higher R^2, indicating better explanatory power. \n",

    "1. Continuous variable can take any numeric value within a range (e.g. age, height, income). The linear regression treats the continuous variable as a numeric input where changes in the variable are directly proportionaly to changes in outcome. This can be explained by the slope, which changes in one unit of the continous variable will change the outcome. \n",
    "- Equation: Y=β0​+β1​X+ϵ\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An indicator variable is a binary variable that takes two values (0,1), repreenting two categories. The indicator variable changes the intercept of the regression line, effecting modeling a different baseline outcome for the two groups. The coefficient(β1) associated with the indicator variable repsents the difference in outcome between the two categories. \n",

    "- When an indicator variable is added, the model now accounts for difference between groups defined by the indicator variable while still modeling the continuous predictor's variable's relationship with outcome. To elaborate, without the indicator variable, the model assumes everyone starts at the same point and moves at the same rate. \n",
    "- Adding the indicator variable changes the behavior by recognizing the difference between the groups, while keeping the function of the continuous variable. Whcih explains how the outcome changes, it just now adjusts for group differences. \n",

    "- The effect of X1 on Y depends on the value of X2, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without Interaction (Additive Model): Predictions assume the effects of 𝑋1and X2are independent. The impact of 𝑋 1 on Y remains constant regardless of the level of 𝑋2, and vice versa. Simpler but less realistic if there’s synergy or dependency between 𝑋1 and 𝑋2 . \n",
    "\n",
    "With Interaction (Interactive Model): Predictions account for synergy or dependency between 𝑋1 and 𝑋2. The effect of 𝑋1 ​ on Y changes depending on the value of 𝑋2 ​ , and vice versa. This model better reflects real-world dynamics where the combined effect of predictors may be greater or smaller than the sum of their individual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-2 \n",
    "\n",
    "When advertisement budgets are categorized as binary variables (high = 1, low = 0), the prediction formulas are adjusted to reflect these discrete categories. For a model without interaction, the formula is 𝑌 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 𝑋 1 + 𝛽 2 𝑋 2 + 𝜖 Y=β 0 ​ +β 1 ​ X 1 ​ +β 2 ​ X 2 ​ +ϵ, where 𝑋 1  ​ represents the TV advertising budget and 𝑋 2 X 2 ​ represents the online advertising budget. Here, 𝛽 0 β 0 ​ is the baseline outcome when both budgets are low, 𝛽 1 β 1 ​ is the change in the outcome when the TV budget is high (holding online constant), and 𝛽 2 β 2 ​ is the change when the online budget is high (holding TV constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model assumes the effects are independent and additive, with no interaction between the predictors. In contrast, a model with interaction includes an additional term: 𝑌 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 𝑋 1 + 𝛽 2 𝑋 2 + 𝛽 3 ( 𝑋 1 ⋅ 𝑋 2 ) + 𝜖 Y=β 0 ​ +β 1 ​ X 1 ​ +β 2 ​ X 2 ​ +β 3 ​ (X 1 ​ ⋅X 2 ​ )+ϵ. The interaction term 𝑋 1 ⋅ 𝑋 2 X 1 ​ ⋅X 2 ​ captures the combined effect of high budgets for both TV and online advertising, represented by 𝛽 3 β 3 ​ . This allows the model to account for scenarios where the effectiveness of one advertising medium depends on the other. For example, if both budgets are high ( 𝑋 1 = 1 , 𝑋 2 = 1 X 1 ​ =1,X 2 ​ =1), the interaction model predicts 𝑌 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 + 𝛽 2 + 𝛽 3 Y=β 0 ​ +β 1 ​ +β 2 ​ +β 3 ​ , reflecting a synergistic or dependent relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without the interaction term, the prediction would simply be 𝑌 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 + 𝛽 2 Y=β 0 ​ +β 1 ​ +β 2 ​ , assuming independent effects. Including the interaction term provides more nuanced predictions by acknowledging that the combined effect of high budgets may amplify or diminish the outcome beyond the sum of individual contributions.\n",

    "### Explanation of Multicollinearity and Its Impact on Model Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. What is the Design Matrix and How Are Predictor Variables Created?**\n",
    "- The **design matrix** (`model4_spec.exog`) is a matrix representing all predictor variables used in the regression model.\n",
    "- Each column in the design matrix corresponds to a predictor variable or an interaction term derived from the formula in `model4_linear_form`.\n",
    "- For example, the term `Attack * Defense` adds both the original predictors and their interaction (multiplicative combination) to the design matrix.\n",
    "- Similarly, higher-order interactions (e.g., `Attack * Defense * Speed`) increase the number of columns, making the matrix more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. What is Multicollinearity and How Does It Manifest in the Design Matrix?**\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity** occurs when two or more predictor variables in the design matrix are highly correlated.\n",
    "- When examined via `np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)`, high correlations indicate redundancy among predictors.\n",
    "- For `model4_fit`, the excessive complexity (due to numerous interaction terms) leads to extreme multicollinearity, where predictors are not independently contributing to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Why Does Multicollinearity Impact Generalizability?**\n",
    "- **High Multicollinearity Causes Instability**:\n",
    "  - Regression coefficients become unreliable and sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",
    "  - The model struggles to isolate the effect of individual predictors because of their high interdependence.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**:\n",
    "  - Multicollinearity amplifies overfitting, as the model captures noise in the training data rather than genuine patterns.\n",
    "- **Condition Number**:\n",
    "  - A large condition number quantifies the degree of multicollinearity. \n",
    "  - For `model4_fit`, the condition number remains astronomically high (e.g., 12 trillion), even after centering and scaling. This indicates severe multicollinearity, undermining the model's robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Why Is Generalizability More Uncertain with Multicollinear Predictors?**\n",
    "- **Pairwise vs. Multivariate Correlations**:\n",
    "  - Pairwise correlations only measure relationships between two variables at a time.\n",
    "  - Multicollinearity considers the collective redundancy among all predictors, which is far more problematic in high-dimensional models like `model4_fit`.\n",
    "- **Prediction Uncertainty**:\n",
    "  - High multicollinearity inflates the standard errors of coefficients, leading to weaker significance tests.\n",
    "  - The model may overfit the training data while failing to generalize to the testing set, as seen in the drastic drop in out-of-sample R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Centering and Scaling**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Normalizing the predictors reduces the artificial inflation of multicollinearity.\n",
    "- **Effect**:\n",
    "  - For `model3_fit`, centering and scaling reduce the condition number dramatically (from 343 to 1.66), indicating minimal multicollinearity.\n",
    "  - For `model4_fit`, even after centering and scaling, the condition number remains excessively large (2.25 quadrillion), highlighting the irreparable complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "The overfitting of `model4_fit` arises from its excessive complexity, resulting in severe multicollinearity in the design matrix. This makes the model too dependent on noise and idiosyncrasies in the training data. Generalizability fails because:\n",
    "1. High multicollinearity inflates prediction uncertainty.\n",
    "2. The model cannot discern genuine patterns from spurious correlations.\n",
    "3. The excessively large condition number serves as a warning that the model's structure is too complex relative to the dataset's size and information content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
    "Simpler models, like `model3_fit`, avoid these pitfalls by focusing on parsimonious relationships with enough evidence in the data to generalize well. Overly complex models, especially in the presence of severe multicollinearity, lack the stability and reliability to perform out-of-sample predictions."

    "The results were as followed:\n",
    "- Model 7 Performance showed better out-of-sample R-squared compared to model6_fit.\n",
    "- Under sequential validation, model7_fit struggles to generalize, especially when predicting Generation 6. The complexity of model7_fit makes it more prone to overfitting.\n",
    "- Model 6 performed more consistently across both scenarios as its more simple structure enables better generalizability, despite lower in-sample performance compared to model7_fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "My interpretation of the codes:\n",
    "- Sequential validation reflects real-world use cases more accurately than random splits. In these scenarios, model7_fit's overfitting tendencies become more evident, while model6_fit proves more reliable.\n",
    "- While model7_fit includes higher-order interaction, these terms capture unimportant results than meaningful relationships.\n",
    "- model6_fit is simpler, leading to lower risk of overfitting and better stability across datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion:\n",
    "- Sequential validation reveals weaknesses in models like model7_fit that might be missed in random train-test splits.\n",
    "- Simpler models are easier to interpret, less prone to overfitting, and often generalize better in real-world settings.\n",
    "- When performance differences are small, prioritize simpler, more interpretable models like model6_fit.\n"
